**About EOS Orbit Co., Ltd.**

EOS Orbit is a Thai-led space technology company specialising in the design, development, and operation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. Founded by a team of engineers and entrepreneurs passionate about advancing Thailand’s space capabilities, EOS Orbit launched LOGSATS, the nation’s first fully operational domestically built satellite. With in-house engineering, mission operations, and R&D capabilities, EOS Orbit is pioneering a new era of accessible, high-performance space technology from Thailand.

**Challenges**

EOS is working on satellite design, and as a deep-tech company building and operating Thailand’s first fully functional LEO satellite, EOS Orbit needed an ERP system that could manage highly technical engineering workflows, strict compliance processes, and rapid R&D cycles. Traditional ERP systems were either too rigid or too costly to customise for satellite manufacturing, multi-stage testing, and supply-chain traceability. Integrating procurement, quality control, HR, and finance into one streamlined platform.

**Benefits**

With Ecosoft’s Thailand tax-compliance expertise and ERPNext’s flexibility, EOS Orbit built end-to-end operational workflows that mirror the real engineering process: from satellite component procurement and assembly logs to test reports to financial and HR automation. Custom modules for Thai payroll, project costing, and quality assurance allowed us to standardise data, eliminate spreadsheets, and gain real-time visibility across engineering, operations, and management. These enhancements also played a key role in helping EOS Orbit achieve ISO 9001 certification.

**Impact**

Ecosoft helped EOS Orbit unlock a unified system that grows with our satellite programs. Our teams now spend less time on manual coordination and more time building space technology. ERPNext has become EOS's digital backbone, enabling faster decision-making, greater accountability, and EOS Orbit's confident scaling as we expand into the new space industry.

> Ecosoft helped transform our operations with ERPNext. Their expertise gave EOS Orbit the system we needed to build Thailand’s first operational satellite, and to scale our mission beyond Earth.
